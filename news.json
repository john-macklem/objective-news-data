The buyback news came on the heels of the chipmaker and AI favorite Nvidia (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;nvda\">NVDA</a>) announcing Tuesday they would <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-and-other-ai-stocks-climb-as-saudi-deals-raise-expectations-of-more-to-come-11734578\">supply semiconductors to Saudi Arabian AI startup Humain</a> as part of initiatives announced as <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trump-touts-deals-with-saudi-arabia-11734068\">President Donald Trump kicked off a four-day trip to the Middle East</a>. </p><p>AMD shares fell about 2% to just under $115 on Thursday. The stock is up 50% from its early-April low and has gained 17% since May 6, when the company posted <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/amd-earnings-q1-fy2025-11728921\">better-than-expected earnings and an upbeat outlook</a> driven by AI momentum.</p><p>Below, we take a closer look at the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/technical-analysis-4689657\">technicals</a> on AMD’s chart and identify crucial price levels worth watching out for.</p><h2>Momentum Accelerates</h2><p>Since a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beartrap.asp\">bear trap</a> marked the bottom in AMD shares last month, the price has broken out above the 50-day moving average and a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descendingchannel.asp\">descending channel</a>, with gains accelerating in recent trading sessions.</p><p>However, while the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp\">relative strength index (RSI)</a> confirms bullish price momentum with a reading above the 70 threshold, it also flashes <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overbought.asp\">overbought</a> conditions, potentially leading to a period of-near-term consolidation.</p><p>Let’s identify crucial <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/support-and-resistance-basics/\">support and resistance</a> levels on AMD’s chart that investors will likely be watching.</p><h2>Crucial Support Levels to Watch</h2><p>A <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/020415/top-strategies-mastering-pullback-trading.asp\">pullback</a> in the shares could initially bring the $110 level into play. The shares may find support in this area on the chart near the October 2023 <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swinghigh.asp\">swing high</a>, which also closely corresponds with a range of trading activity between February and May this year.</p><p>Further <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downside.asp\">downside</a> could see the shares revisit lower support around $96. Investors may seek buying opportunities in this location near a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/horizontal-line.asp\">horizontal line</a> that connects three prominent troughs on the chart stretching back to the September 2023 low.</p><h2>Important Resistance Levels to Monitor</h2><p>A continuation of stock’s recent bullish momentum could propel a move northward toward $132, This area, currently just above the closely watched <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/013015/why-200-simple-moving-average-sma-so-common-traders-and-analysts.asp\">200-day moving average</a>, may provide overhead selling pressure near last August’s notable <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swinglow.asp\">swing low</a> and January’s countertrend high.</p><p>Finally, buying above this level opens the door for a rally up to the important $150 region. Investors who have <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accumulating-shares.asp\">accumulated AMD shares</a> at lower prices may decide to <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lock_in_profits.asp\">lock in profits</a> in this location near a trendline that links multiple <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/peak-and-trough-analysis/\">peaks and troughs</a> on the chart from December 2023 to November last year.</p><p><em>The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
