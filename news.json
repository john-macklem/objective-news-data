Blocking FTL1 reversed these effects, suggesting a potential target for treating age-related cognitive decline. Additionally, researchers found two brain regions acting as a \"neural compass\" for orientation in virtual environments. This discovery could lead to new methods for diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders that impair navigational skills.",
