The president said that the tariffs are designed to bring manufacturing and business investment back into the country while raising revenue for the federal government.</p><p>To quantify the magnitude of these changes, here are three graphs that help explain the new tariff policies.</p><h2>This Is the Highest Effective Tariff Rate in More Than a Century</h2><p></p><p>The effective tariff rate measures the total taxes levied on imports. It's a good way to account for all tariff policies that a country has in place.</p><p>In the U.S., that rateÂ was 2.4% when Trump took office earlier this year.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span> Economists have worked to <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/what-will-the-average-tariff-be-under-trump-s-new-policies-11708218\">enumerate the average effective rate</a> after the announcement of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trade-experts-question-trump-team-method-for-calculating-tariffs-11708336\">\"reciprocal\" tariffs</a> this week and have used different calculations, with most ranging between 20% and 30%.</p><p>According to researchers at the Yale Budget Lab this week, the effective tariff rate will rise to more than 22% when all the tariff measures announced are enacted. That includes the 11.5% that stems from the new tariffs unveiled this week and is the highest since 1909.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span><br /></p><h2>Prices on Goods Will Likely Increase</h2><p></p><p>Most economists agree that <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-are-tariffs-and-how-do-they-affect-you/\">tariffs</a> will increase the price of goods for average Americans.</p><p>Because importers are being taxed at a higher level when goods are shipped into the country, they often pass on those increased costs to consumers. Yale Budget Lab estimates that, in total, tariffs could cost the typical household <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tariffs-will-cost-typical-household-usd3-800-a-year-analysis-says-11708786\">$3,800 per year</a>.</p><p>However, some items will cost more than others, with leather goods and clothes expected to experience the highest increases.</p><h2>The Impacts of Tariffs Could Be Felt for a Long Time</h2><p></p><p>In addition to pushing up prices, economists said the tariffs could slow the economy's growth and raise the chances of a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/avoid-five-recession-risks.asp\">recession</a>.</p><p>Trump has said he's prepared for temporary pain as the global economy adjusts to his new policies.
