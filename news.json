Despite a strong performance in a challenging macroeconomic environment, the company adjusted its full-year EPS forecast down by a dollar to $22.30, mainly due to the impact of policy changes, including U.S.-China tariffs. Following the announcement, Thermo Fisher shares rose nearly 5% but later reduced some of the gains."
