      "A new study on the genetic causes of the PTEN Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome (PHTS) has found that inhibitors of the PI3ka pathway, commonly used as anticancer drugs, are also effective against this disease, reducing the extent of vascular malformations and lesion-associated pain in animal models. The research suggests the repurposing of these drugs may offer a new hope for PHTS patients, especially at younger ages."
