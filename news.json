Gold backed off its highs after Trump said that tariffs on China would likely be <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trump-s-tariffs-could-be-at-their-peak-but-there-are-some-caveats-11720442\">significantly reduced</a> and that he has <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trump-says-he-has-no-intention-of-firing-fed-chair-powell-stock-futures-rise-update-11720202\">no intention of firing Powell</a> from his role.</p><p>The price of gold has soared 28% since the start of the year, boosted by worries that tariffs could slow <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trump-tariffs-raise-inflation-unemployment-recession-stagflation-risks-11708571\">economic growth and reignite inflation</a>, sending investors flocking to the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/safe-haven.asp\">safe-have</a> asset that is often seen a hedge against rising prices.

This area may provide support near the early-April swing high, which finds <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/confluence.asp\">confluence</a> from the 38.2% <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonacciretracement.asp\">Fibonacci retracement</a> level when applying a grid from the last year’s December low to this month’s high.</p><p>The next lower area to watch sits at $2,955, just above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level.
