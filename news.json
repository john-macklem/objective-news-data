This is thought to be due to highly reactive components in particulate matter, which affect biological processes in the body. However, researchers have now shown that precisely these components disappear within hours and that previous measurements therefore completely underestimate the quantities in which they are present."

      "Every night, bats emerge out of roosts in massive numbers, creating what scientists have called a 'cocktail party nightmare' of clashing echolocations. Nobody knew how bats managed this severe sensorial challenge. Now, scientists have tracked bats within a group of thousands to find out: when bats first emerge from the roost, they increase their distance from the center of the group and adjust their echolocation to maneuver safely in the areas of highest bat density."

By tracking thousands of bats, they found that bats increase their distance from the group's center and adjust their echolocation to avoid collisions in densely populated areas, overcoming what is known as a 'cocktail party nightmare' of overlapping echolocations.",
