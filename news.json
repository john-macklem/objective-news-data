    "summary": "Japanese researchers, including a team from the Earth-Life Science Institute in Tokyo, discovered a \"global constraint principle\" that explains why organism growth slows with increased nutrient availability, a concept known as the law of diminishing returns. This principle, which combines classic biological laws, was confirmed through simulations with E. coli. It suggests that growth is sequentially limited by multiple factors, offering a new mathematical explanation for a well-observed biological phenomenon.",
