      "<p><strong>Cannes film festival<br /></strong>Drawn from a suppressed story by gulag survivor Georgy Demidov, Sergei Loznitsa’s haunting film unravels a terrifying parable of bureaucratic evil<br /></p><p>An icy chill of fear and justified paranoia radiates from this starkly austere and gripping movie from Sergei Loznitsa, set in Stalin’s Russia of the late 30s and based on a story by the dissident author and scientist Georgy Demidov, who was held in the gulag for 14 years during the second world war and harassed by the state until his death in the late 1980s.<br /><br />\n The resulting movie, with its slow, extended scenes from single camera positions, mimics the zombie existence of the Soviet state and allows a terrible anxiety to accumulate: it is about a malign bureaucracy which protects and replicates itself by infecting those who challenge it with a bacillus of guilt. There is something of Dostoevsky’s The House of the Dead and also – with the appearance of two strangely grinning, singing men in a railway carriage – Kafka’s The Castle.</p><p>Loznitsa moreover allows us also to register that the wretched political prisoner of his tale is a veteran of Stalin’s brutal battle to suppress the Ukrainian nationalist Symon Petliura. And given the nightmarish claustrophobia and disorientation in the scenes in cells, official corridors, staircases and government antechambers, there is maybe a filmic footnote in the fact that Demidov worked for the scientist Lev Landau, the subject of Ilya Khrzhanovsky’s huge and deeply pessimistic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/26/dau-natasha-review-russia-ilya-khrzhanovsky\">multi-movie installation project Dau</a> in 2020.<br /><br />\n The first prosecutor of the title is Kornyev, played by Aleksandr Kuznetsov, an idealistic young lawyer, given a startlingly early promotion to a state prosecutor role – his beardless youth fascinates and irritates the grizzled old time-servers with whom he comes into contact.<br /><br />\n He has received a bizarre “letter” from Stepniak (Aleksandr Fillipenko) an ageing and desperately ill high security prisoner in Bryansk – written in blood on a piece of torn cardboard (which has escaped the bonfire that prison authorities make of protest letters like these). The letter alleges that the security services, the NKVD, are without reference to the rule of law, using the prisons and judicial system to torture and murder an entire older generation of party veterans like him, to bring in a fanatically loyal but callow and incompetent cohort of Stalin loyalists.<br /><br />\n The prison authorities make the politely persistent Kornyev wait hours before being allowed to visit Stepniak in his cell, transparently hoping he will just give up and go away – Loznitsa shows this weaponised inertia is the traditional official approach to petitioners everywhere in the Soviet Union.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/14/two-prosecutors-review-a-petrifying-portrait-of-stalinist-insurrection\">Continue reading...</a>"

However, the stock has nearly doubled from last month’s low amid a rebound in the AI trade and expectations that the firm’s software could benefit from ongoing efforts to improve government efficiency.</p><p>Below, we break down the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/technical-analysis-4689657\">technicals</a> on Palantir’s chart and identify major price levels that investors may be watching.</p><h2>Pennant Pattern Breakout</h2><p>After forming a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/piercing-pattern.asp\">piercing pattern</a> early last month, Palantir shares have staged a sharp rally, climbing above the prominent February <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/peak-and-trough-analysis/\">peak</a> in the process. </p><p>More recently, the price <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consolidation.asp\">consolidated</a> within a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennant.asp\">pennant</a> before breaking out in Tuesday’s trading session, indicating a continuation of the stock’s longer-term <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptrend.asp\">uptrend</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp\">relative strength index</a> points to bullish momentum with a reading above the indicator’s neutral threshold, though it remains below <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overbought.asp\">overbought</a> levels, providing ample room for further buying.</p><p>Let’s use <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp\">technical analysis</a> to forecast where the AI software provider’s stock may be headed next and also identify major <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp\">support levels</a> worth watching during potential retracements.</p><h2>Bars Pattern Analysis</h2><p>To forecast where the stock’s price may be headed next, investors can use bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes prior <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trendanalysis.asp\">trends</a> to predict future price movements.</p><p>When applying the analysis to Palantir’s chart, we extract the price bars comprising the stock’s trending move that immediately preceded the pennant and reposition them from the pattern’s <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/trading-breakouts.asp\">breakout</a> point. </p><p>This projects an <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/upside.asp\">upside</a> target of around $210 and indicates the move may play out until early to mid-June if the current trend higher replicates the prior trend analyzed.</p><h2>Major Support Levels Worth Watching</h2><p>During retracements, investors should pay close pay attention to the $97 level, currently situated just above the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012815/why-50-simple-moving-average-sma-so-common-traders-and-analysts.asp\">50-day moving average (MA)</a>. The shares may encounter support in this area near the March peak, which closely aligns with brief period on consolidation that formed on the chart in mid-April.</p><p>Finally, selling below this major level could see Palantir shares test lower support around $66. Investors may seek <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entry-point.asp\">entry points</a> in this region near the close-by 200-day MA and a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/horizontal-line.asp\">horizontal line</a> that connects last month’s low with the notable January trough.</p><p><em>The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
