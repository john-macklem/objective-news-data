This area may attract sellers near last month’s <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swinghigh.asp\">swing high</a> and the stock’s post-election <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakawaygap.asp\">breakaway gap</a> opening price.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/trading-breakouts.asp\">breakout</a> above this key technical level could trigger a rally to the $360 area.

This area would likely provide support near the March and April <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/peak-and-trough-analysis/\">troughs</a> that mark the stock’s potential double bottom.

Falling car insurance and airline ticket prices helped keep core inflation running cooler than expected: the median forecast called for 3% year-over-year core inflation.<br /><br />The report showed consumer prices were headed in the right direction in March despite several of President Donald Trump's tariffs having taken effect that month. Some <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/despite-trump-s-pause-the-tariffs-in-place-can-still-do-economic-damage-11712202\">tariffs against Canada and Mexico went into effect in March</a>, and there was a 20% increase in tariffs against China. Since then, Trump has hiked tariffs against China to 125%, imposed a 25% tariff on auto imports, and implemented a global 10% tariff against products from nearly every country in the world. Economists expect those import taxes to <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/economists-see-greater-chance-of-recession-with-trump-tariffs-11710261\">push up consumer prices</a> in the coming months, potentially stoking inflation.<br /><br />\"This report could be like reading an old newspaper from a different reality,\"  David Russell, head of market strategy at online brokerage firm TradeStation, wrote in a commentary.<br /><br />A drop in consumer prices would normally be music to the ears of Federal Reserve policymakers, who adjust the nation's monetary policy to keep inflation running at an annual rate of around 2%. Fed officials have held their benchmark fed funds rate at a higher-than-usual level in recent months in an effort to extinguish the last embers of the post-pandemic burst of high inflation.<br /><br />Fed officials anticipate lowering their key fed funds rate, which influences interest rates on all kinds of loans, in response to falling inflation. However, Trump's tariff campaign could make them reluctant to do so. Fed officials have said they'll stay in <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/fed-chair-powell-confirms-wait-and-see-approach-to-rate-cuts-11693204\">\"wait and see\" mode</a> until the impact of the tariffs becomes clear.<br /><br />\"March’s inflation data is encouraging but will do little to calm nerves at the Federal Reserve as they wait to parse through the effects of dramatic changes in U.S. trade policy,\" Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's Analytics, wrote in a commentary.<br /></p><h2>When Will Government Data Show Tariff Impact?</h2><p>Although tariffs were in effect in March, it may take a while before they show up in price tags and inflation data if <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/what-happened-the-last-time-trump-imposed-tariffs-8785151\">past trade wars</a> are anything to go by.</p><p>In 2018, when Trump raised tariffs on washing machines, it took three months for the import taxes to be passed on to consumers, Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a commentary.<br /><br />\"This suggests May is the earliest that the CPI data will start to pick up in response to the tariffs,\" Tombs wrote.<br /></p>"

    "summary": "In March, consumer prices in the U.S. experienced their most significant decline since 2020, primarily due to a decrease in gas prices, which offset increases in grocery costs. This led to the lowest annual inflation increase since September. Despite the implementation of tariffs by President Trump, including a notable hike against China and new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and auto imports, these measures had not yet impacted inflation figures. Economists anticipate that the effects of these tariffs will start to be seen in consumer prices and inflation data from May onwards. The Consumer Price",
