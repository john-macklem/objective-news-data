      "When it comes to upgrading electrical and broadband infrastructure, new research shows that a 'dig once' approach is nearly 40% more cost effective than replacing them separately. The study also found that the greatest benefit comes from proactively undergrounding lines that are currently above ground, even if lines haven't reached the end of their usefulness."

    "summary": "New research indicates that upgrading electrical and broadband infrastructure simultaneously, known as the 'dig once' method, is almost 40% more cost-effective than updating them separately. The study highlights that the most significant savings come from moving existing above-ground lines underground proactively, before they are due for replacement. This approach not only reduces costs but also potentially enhances the longevity and reliability of the infrastructure.",
