The president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe,\" Ackman posted to X on Sunday evening. \"The consequences for our country and the millions of our citizens who have supported the president—in particular low-income consumers who are already under a huge amount of economic stress—are going to be severely negative. This is not what we voted for.\" </p><h2>'Economic Nuclear War'</h2><p>Ackman equated Trump's reciprocal tariffs—including a 20% levy on imports from the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanunion.asp\">European Union</a>, 46% on Vietnamese goods, and 24% on Japanese products—with declaring \"economic nuclear war on every country in the world,\" and warned the move would obstruct investment in the U.S. and cause lasting damage to America’s reputation on the world stage. </p><p>In separate posts Sunday evening and Monday morning, Ackman placed blame for the tariff plans squarely on the president's advisors. \"I just figured out why &#64;howardlutnick is indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing,\" he wrote late Sunday, referring to Commerce Secretary and former Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick. \"He and Cantor are long bonds. He profits when our economy implodes,\" Ackman wrote.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span> </p><p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett criticized Ackman on <em>Fox News</em> on Monday morning, saying, \"I would urge everyone, especially Bill, to ease off the rhetoric a little bit. ... The idea that it's gonna be a 'nuclear winter' or something like that is completely irresponsible rhetoric.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span></p><h2>Ackman Softens Lutnick Comments Monday</h2><p>Ackman softened his comments on Lutnick Monday morning, writing that \"It was unfair of me to lash out at &#64;howardlutnick.
