This is part of the first 3D picture of the planet's atmosphere, which shows storms are primarily shallow."

This uneven distribution is linked to the planet's intense lightning storms, which create updrafts that form slushy, ice-coated hailstones made of ammonia and water. These hailstones then fall into the planet, creating areas with depleted ammonia levels.
