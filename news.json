Bush signed the REAL ID Act to establish federal standards for identification documents into law in May 2005.</p><p>That looks set to end May 7, when its Transportation Security Administration unit says at long last it will step up enforcement. \"If you plan to fly, make sure you get a Real ID so you won't be denied from your flight or face travel delays!\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said on a recent X post.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span></p><p>Here's what this means for American travelers.</p><h2>Countdown Clock</h2><p>Despite having extended the deadline on multiple occasions over the decades, the DHS insists REAL ID enforcement will take place soon. It even has a \"Countdown to REAL ID Enforcement\" clock ticking down on its website.</p><p>The bottom line: If you want to travel using your state driver's license or ID—or do other activities that require federal identification—you'll need it to be a REAL ID, though other forms of identification, such as valid passports, can also work. A <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification\">full list is here</a>.</p><p>\"On May 7, 2025, U.S. travelers must be REAL ID compliant to board domestic flights and access certain federal facilities,\" reads the DHS website, which has an interactive tool to help people determine if they're \"REAL ID ready\" that you can <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/real-id/are-you-real-id-ready\">check out here</a>.</p><p>In a statement provided to <em>Investopedia</em>, the TSA said that beginning May 7, \"every air traveler 18 years of age and older is expected to have a REAL ID-compliant ID. That is a state-issued driver's license, state-issued identification card or another acceptable form of ID.\"</p><p>REAL ID-compliant IDs are marked with a star. The TSA also will continue accepting Enhanced Driver's Licenses, which \"provide proof of identity and U.S. citizenship when crossing the U.S. border and are available in Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, and Washington.\"</p><h2>What Will ID Checks Be Like at Airports Starting May 7?</h2><p>Things may be bumpy at the start. Asked what will happen to passengers who arrive at U.S. airports without acceptable ID on May 7, the TSA say they \"should plan to arrive at airports about three hours in advance of their flight, as delays are possible at the identity verification station within checkpoints.\"</p><p>As of April 11, more than 80% of travelers at TSA checkpoints were presenting acceptable identification, the TSA said, adding it \"expects the number of passengers obtaining REAL IDs to steadily increase and will continue with additional screening measures for those without a REAL ID until it is no longer considered a security vulnerability.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span> </p><p>If you're in the estimated 20% of Americans not already compliant, DHS instructs you to \"visit your state's driver’s licensing agency website to find out exactly what documentation is required to obtain a REAL ID.\"</p>"

That still hasn't happened.</li><li>However, the Department of Homeland Security now says it will begin enforcement on May 7.</li><li>The government says passengers hoping to fly then without REAL ID-compliant identification \"should plan to arrive at airports about three hours in advance of their flight, as delays are possible at the identity verification station within checkpoints.\"</li></ul><br /><br /><p>The REAL ID Act, signed into law 20 years ago, still hasn't gone into effect.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span> This time, though, the Department of Homeland Security swears it will—starting early next month.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span></p><p>Republican and Democratic administrations alike have kicked the can down the road since President George W. Bush signed the REAL ID Act to establish federal standards for identification documents into law in May 2005.</p><p>That looks set to end May 7, when its Transportation Security Administration unit says at long last it will step up enforcement. \"If you plan to fly, make sure you get a Real ID so you won't be denied from your flight or face travel delays!\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said on a recent X post.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span></p><p>Here's what this means for American travelers.</p><h2>Countdown Clock</h2><p>Despite having extended the deadline on multiple occasions over the decades, the DHS insists REAL ID enforcement will take place soon. It even has a \"Countdown to REAL ID Enforcement\" clock ticking down on its website.</p><p>The bottom line: If you want to travel using your state driver's license or ID—or do other activities that require federal identification—you'll need it to be a REAL ID, though other forms of identification, such as valid passports, can also work. A <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification\">full list is here</a>.</p><p>\"On May 7, 2025, U.S. travelers must be REAL ID compliant to board domestic flights and access certain federal facilities,\" reads the DHS website, which has an interactive tool to help people determine if they're \"REAL ID ready\" that you can <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/real-id/are-you-real-id-ready\">check out here</a>.</p><p>In a statement provided to <em>Investopedia</em>, the TSA said that beginning May 7, \"every air traveler 18 years of age and older is expected to have a REAL ID-compliant ID. That is a state-issued driver's license, state-issued identification card or another acceptable form of ID.\"</p><p>REAL ID-compliant IDs are marked with a star. The TSA also will continue accepting Enhanced Driver's Licenses, which \"provide proof of identity and U.S. citizenship when crossing the U.S. border and are available in Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, and Washington.\"</p><h2>What Will ID Checks Be Like at Airports Starting May 7?</h2><p>Things may be bumpy at the start. Asked what will happen to passengers who arrive at U.S. airports without acceptable ID on May 7, the TSA say they \"should plan to arrive at airports about three hours in advance of their flight, as delays are possible at the identity verification station within checkpoints.\"</p><p>As of April 11, more than 80% of travelers at TSA checkpoints were presenting acceptable identification, the TSA said, adding it \"expects the number of passengers obtaining REAL IDs to steadily increase and will continue with additional screening measures for those without a REAL ID until it is no longer considered a security vulnerability.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span> </p><p>If you're in the estimated 20% of Americans not already compliant, DHS instructs you to \"visit your state's driver’s licensing agency website to find out exactly what documentation is required to obtain a REAL ID.\"</p>"
