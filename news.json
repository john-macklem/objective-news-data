    "summary": "The article examines why Senator Marco Rubio successfully aligned with the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement, while Senator Lindsey Graham did not. It suggests that Rubio's actions and positions have more closely matched the expectations and values of the MAGA base, leading to his successful assimilation into the movement. In contrast, Graham's actions or positions have apparently not resonated as well with the MAGA base, resulting in his failure to assimilate as effectively as Rubio.",
