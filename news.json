In the week after Trump’s tariff announcement, 49% of fund managers surveyed by Bank of America labeled “long gold” Wall Street’s most crowded trade. It was the first BofA Global Fund Manager Survey in two years in which “long <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/magnificent-seven-stocks-8402262\">Magnificent Seven</a>” wasn’t thought to be the most popular trade.

Powell said trade policy could be a setback to both sides of the Fed's \"<a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100715/breaking-down-federal-reserves-dual-mandate.asp\">dual mandate</a>\" to keep inflation under control and joblessness in check. Powell suggested the Fed wasn't ready to jump in to boost financial markets and the economy by cutting interest rates—at least not yet.</p><h2>Fed Is Unlikely To Cut Its Influential Interest Rate</h2><p>Powell echoed the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/fed-officials-are-bracing-for-higher-inflation-slower-growth-from-tariffs-11714034\">recent comments of other Fed officials</a>, saying the tariff war could pose a \"challenging\" scenario by slowing down the economy while pushing up prices.</p><p>The Fed's main tool for managing the economy is raising or lowering the <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp\">federal funds rate</a>, which influences borrowing costs on all kinds of loans. A higher fed funds rate means more costly loans, and a slower economy, reducing inflation pressures. A lower fed funds rate means easy money and a boost to the job market.<br /><br />The Fed has been keeping the rate high in recent years to combat the post-pandemic surge of inflation, and Powell's remarks indicated the Fed would be reluctant to cut rates even if financial markets took a dive.<br /><br />When asked whether the Fed would step in with rate cuts if markets plunged, Powell said, \"No, with an explanation\"—markets were functioning in an orderly fashion and predictably responding to the uncertainty surrounding the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/economists-see-few-winners-in-us-china-trade-war-11715135\">rapidly changing tariff policies</a>.</p><h2>Powell Reluctant To Look Through Price Increases</h2><p>A <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tariff.asp\">tariff</a> is, in theory, a one-time price increase, whereas <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\">inflation</a> is, by definition, a sustained increase in prices.</p><p>By that logic, central bank doctrine dictates the Fed should \"look through\" tariff-driven price increases and not necessarily raise interest rates or keep them high in response. However, Powell said the central bank's experience during the pandemic challenged that logic.</p><p>For example, he said, disruptions in the supply of computer chips affected car prices, which were a major reason overall inflation surged in 2022. He said the Fed was determined not to let that happen again.<br /><br />\"Our role is to make sure that this is a one-time increase in prices and not something that turns into an ongoing inflation process,\" he said.<br /></p>"

Noting declines in business and consumer sentiment, Powell suggested the Fed is poised to await more visibility on possible tariff impacts before modifying interest rates.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 ended the session 2.2% lower, while the Dow declined 1.7%.

Although first-quarter sales and profits edged out expectations, executives noted that tariffs were weighing on demand as customers attempt to gauge the potential impact on their supply chains and overall businesses. J.B. Hunt stressed that it is evaluating options to reduce its costs as it navigates these challenges.</p><p>The top executive from marketing and corporate communications firm Omnicom (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;omc\">OMC</a>) reaffirmed plans to move forward with the acquisition of advertising giant Interpublic Group (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;ipg\">IPG</a>), pushing back against claims that the deal could result in client losses.
