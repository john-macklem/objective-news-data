Morgan analysts who recently pointed out that the company would only need to increase its global prices by 4%, based on the portion of its hardware that would be affected by tariffs.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span></p><p>Supermicro shares saw significant price swings in both directions during the first quarter as the company dealt with accounting issues that raised concerns of a potential Nasdaq delisting until the company <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/supermicro-stock-soars-in-extended-trading-as-server-maker-meets-filing-deadline-11686437\">met the exchange’s deadline to file several delayed financial reports in February</a>. The stock was up 6% at around $35 in recent trading.</p><p>Below, we break down the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/technical-analysis-4689657\">technicals</a> on Supermicro’s chart and identify major price levels that investors may be monitoring.</p><h2>Potential Bear Trap</h2><p>After <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gapping.asp\">gapping</a> lower in late October, Supermicro shares oscillated within an orderly <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ascendingchannel.asp\">ascending channel</a> until breaking down below the pattern’s lower trendline toward the end of last month.</p><p>However, despite falling to its lowest level since early February last week, the stock completed a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullishengulfingpattern.asp\">bullish engulfing pattern</a> in Monday’s trading session, potentially forming a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beartrap.asp\">bear trap</a>—a trading event that lures investors to sell upon a breach of major <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp\">support</a> before the price makes a sudden move higher.</p><p>What’s more, Monday’s buying coincided with the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp\">relative strength index (RSI)</a> rallying from a reading of around 35, the same level the indicator bottomed at in early February before the stock roughly doubled over a two-week period.</p><p>Let’s identify two major overhead areas to watch on Supermicro’s chart amid the potential for follow-through buying, and also point out vital support levels worth monitoring.</p><h2>Major Overhead Areas to Watch</h2><p>A decisive close back above the ascending channel’s lower trendline could trigger a rally to around $48. This level, currently just above the closely watched <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/013015/why-200-simple-moving-average-sma-so-common-traders-and-analysts.asp\">200-day moving average</a>, connects a range of comparable trading activity on the chart extending back to last year’s prominent August <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swinglow.asp\">swing low</a>.</p><p>Buying above this price could see the stock revisit the $63 area. Investors who have <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accumulating-shares.asp\">accumulated shares</a> during the stock’s recent decline may decide to <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lock_in_profits.asp\">lock in profits</a> in this region near a trendline that links last year's late-August peak with the February <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swinghigh.asp\">swing high</a>.</p><p>Interestingly, this location also sits in the same vicinity as a projected bars pattern target that takes the stock’s sharp <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trendanalysis.asp\">trend</a> higher during February and overlays it from the low of yesterday’s bullish engulfing candle.</p><h2>Vital Support Levels Worth Monitoring</h2><p>A breach of the bullish engulfing candle's low could see Supermicro shares initially retrace to around $26, a location on the chart where they may attract support near the January <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/peak-and-trough-analysis/\">trough</a> and early-November <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/10/trend-following-countertrend.asp\">countertrend</a> high.</p><p>Finally, a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakdown.asp\">breakdown</a> below this level paves the way for a potential drop to $17. Investors may seek <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/03/071803.asp\">buy-and-hold</a> opportunities in this region near the mid-November trough, which also marks the stock’s <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/52weekhighlow.asp\">52-week low</a>.</p><p><em>The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

This surge comes after the stock faced substantial losses during a broader market sell-off influenced by tariffs. Analysts from J.P. Morgan suggested that the company could offset tariff impacts by raising global prices by 4%. The stock's recent volatility is also tied to concerns about a potential Nasdaq delisting, which were alleviated when Supermicro met the filing deadline for delayed financial reports in February. The shares were trading up 6% at around ",
