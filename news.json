Cook revealed that the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. this quarter would be sourced from India, not China, with other products primarily coming from Vietnam, as a response to trade tensions with China and tariffs impacting the company. Despite these challenges, Apple's fiscal second-quarter revenue and earnings exceeded analysts' expectations, driven by robust iPhone sales. However, Apple's stock fell about 4% in extended tradi",
