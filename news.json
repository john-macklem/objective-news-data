    "summary": "In 2023, scientists discovered the cause behind a phenomenon where the Earth shook every 90 seconds for 9 days. Using satellite and seismic data, they determined that mega tsunamis in Greenland fjords generated trapped standing waves, which were responsible for the consistent shaking. This conclusion provides a clear explanation for the unusual seismic activity observed during that period.",
