The shares may run into overhead selling pressure in this area near the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/02/061802.asp\">psychological round number</a> and a trendline that links a range of corresponding <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-action.asp\">price action</a> on the chart extending back to August last year.</p><p>Finally, buying above this level brings the $63 level into play.
