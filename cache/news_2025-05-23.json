    "summary": "Scientists from Ludwig Cancer Research have developed a new antibody, PLT012, that targets the fat transporter CD36, enhancing the immune system's ability to attack tumors. This discovery reveals a crucial mechanism where immune cells in tumors absorb fat, acting as a metabolic checkpoint that dampens immune responses. This breakthrough offers a novel strategy for treating cancers resistant to current immunotherapies, potentially improving outcomes for patients with such conditions.",
