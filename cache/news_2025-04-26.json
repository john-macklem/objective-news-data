    "summary": "A recent study has identified a gene, previously known as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, as a direct cause of the condition. This discovery was made possible by uncovering the gene's secondary function, which activates a pathway that interferes with the cellular process responsible for turning genes on and off in the brain. This breakthrough provides new insight into the biological mechanisms behind Alzheimer's disease."
