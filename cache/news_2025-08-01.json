    "summary": "A recent study highlighted by SciTechDaily suggests a potential link between diet and depression. The research raises concerns that certain dietary patterns may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms. However, the specific details of the study, such as the diet types examined or the sample size, were not provided in the summary content. The outcome indicates an ongoing interest in understanding how nutrition impacts mental health, but further research is needed to establish a definitive connection.",

    "constructiveness_reason": "This story increases basic awareness about the potential link between diet and depression but lacks depth or insight. It does not provide actionable insights for readers, such as which specific diets may contribute to depression. The story also does not report on solutions or improvements, but rather suggests that more research is needed."
