    "summary": "Recent research indicates that around 1500 BC, significant changes occurred in Bronze Age Central Europe. Diets became more limited, with the introduction of millet, migration rates decreased, and there was a shift towards more flexible social systems. This new evidence challenges previous beliefs about the nomadic lifestyle of the Tumulus culture herders, suggesting a move away from their traditional practices during this period.",
