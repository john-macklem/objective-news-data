Meanwhile, a report from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute revealed that social housing waitlists in Australia increased by over 26,000 households in the six years leading up to 2022, while the number of households gaining access to social housing decreased by 6,400. The report emphasizes the need for stronger housing assistance measures beyond the current social housing stock and suggests legislation to guarantee the right to adequate housing assistance.",
