    "summary": "Scientists achieved a historic breakthrough by detecting a landslide-generated tsunami from a research ship using satellite data for the first time. This method addresses a gap in current tsunami warning systems, which primarily detect tsunamis caused by earthquakes but frequently miss those triggered by landslides. This advancement could significantly improve safety for coastal communities, especially in areas with narrow fjords where the impact of such tsunamis can be amplified.",
