    "summary": "A recent study has revealed that the elevation of the Tibetan Plateau, often referred to as the \"Roof of the World,\" was primarily driven by mantle upwelling rather than the longstanding theory of the India-Asia tectonic plate convergence. This challenges the traditional understanding of the plateau's formation, which attributed its rise to the continuous collision of the Indian and Asian continental plates since the Cenozoic era. The findings suggest that post-collisional mantle dynamics played a key role in shaping the region's topography.",
