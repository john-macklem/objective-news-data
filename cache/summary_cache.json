DNA damage can trigger these cells to either gray hair as a protective measure or, if overridden by carcinogens, lead to melanoma. Separately, scientists discovered a \"switch\" in lung cells that decides between tissue repair and infection fighting, a breakthrough that could enhance treatments for chronic lung diseases and aid in recovery post-injury.",

    "summary": "Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, made landfall in Jamaica as the strongest storm to hit the island since records began in 1851, with winds reaching 185 mph. It caused catastrophic damage, including flash flooding, landslides, and severe structural damage. The storm has killed at least 3 people in Jamaica and is expected to continue causing devastation as it moves toward Cuba. This event marks Melissa as one of the most powerful hurricanes on record in the Atlantic Basin, exacerbated by unusually high sea temperatures linked to global warming.",
