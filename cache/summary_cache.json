  "mysterious 380 million-year-old fish reveals secrets of our land-walking ancestors": "Researchers have discovered a 380 million-year-old fossil of the extinct lungfish Chirodipterus australis, shedding light on the evolutionary transition of vertebrates from water to land. The study, focusing on the fish's skull structure, reveals insights into how early vertebrates might have used their jaws in new ways as they adapted to terrestrial environments. This finding enhances our understanding of the evolutionary adaptations necessary for life on land.",
