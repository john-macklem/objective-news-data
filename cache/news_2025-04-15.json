Despite concerns over the economy and the impact of tariffs, consumer spending, a key economic factor, remained strong in March. Economists expect a 1.2% increase in retail sales for March over the previous month, with car sales playing a significant role in this growth. However, excluding automobiles and gasoline, the growth is projected to be just 0.2%. This anticipated boost in March does",
