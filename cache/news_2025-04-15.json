This area on the chart would likely attract significant attention near the stock’s <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/051315/how-trade-stocks-hit-alltime-highs.asp\">all-time high (ATH)</a> and may be seen as a suitable location for <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profittaking.asp\">profit-taking</a> opportunities.</p><p>A move above the ATH into <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricediscovery.asp\">price discovery</a> mode could set the stage for a longer-term rally to around $300. We projected this bullish target by applying bars pattern analysis, which takes the stock’s <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trendanalysis.asp\">trend</a> higher from August to February and overlays it from this month’s low.</p><p>Interestingly, the prior trend analyzed followed a bullish engulfing pattern, potentially providing insight as to how a new move higher from a similar chart setup may play out. </p><h2>Important Support Levels Worth Monitoring</h2><p>During <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retracement.asp\">retracements</a> in the stock, it’s worth keeping an eye on the $66 level. Palantir bulls would likely look to defend this area near last week’s low and several comparable price points on the chart extending back to early November.</p><p>Finally, a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakdown.asp\">breakdown</a> below this important technical area could see Palantir shares revisit lower support around $45. Investors may look for <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entry-point.asp\">entry points</a> in this location near the upper range of a brief <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consolidation.asp\">consolidation</a> period that preceded last year’s post-election rally.</p><p><em>The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
