Analysts indicated that these factors are contributing to lower levels of confidence around upcoming earnings estimates. BofA downgraded Dow (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;dow\">DOW</a>) stock to \"underperform\" from \"buy,\" and shares of the chemicals giant lost 4.0% following the double downgrade.</p><p>Shares of Molina Healthcare (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;moh\">MOH</a>) sank 3.8% after Baird analysts downgraded the stock to \"neutral\" from \"outperform.\" According to the analyst team, companies in the managed care and health care facilities industries could be unlikely to increase their guidance in the near term given policy uncertainties related to Medicare Part D programs.<br /></p>"
