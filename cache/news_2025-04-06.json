    "summary": "Researchers have developed a clinical-grade antiviral chewing gum that significantly reduces viral loads of two herpes simplex viruses and two influenza A strains in experimental models. This innovation highlights a potential new strategy to combat low vaccination rates for influenza and the absence of a vaccine for HSV by reducing viral transmission through an alternative method.",
