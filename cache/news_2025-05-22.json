That bullish sentiment ended abruptly on Wednesday.</p><p>Let’s identify several <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/support-and-resistance-basics/\">support and resistance</a> levels on Palo Alto’s chart that investors will likely be watching.</p><h2>Key Support Levels to Watch</h2><p>The first lower level to watch sits around $180. This area, currently located roughly midway between the 50- and<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/013015/why-200-simple-moving-average-sma-so-common-traders-and-analysts.asp\"> 200-day moving averages</a>, may provide support near a trendline that connects a range of corresponding <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-action.asp\">price action</a> on the chart stretching back to last September.</p><p>Selling below this level raises the possibility for a steeper drop to the $165 level. Investors could seek longer-term <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyandhold.asp\">buy-and-hold</a> opportunities in this region near January’s <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retracement.asp\">retracement</a> to the 200-day MA, which also closely aligns with troughs that formed on the chart during September and October last year.</p><h2>Key Resistance Levels to Monitor</h2><p>Upon a resumption of the stock’s recent move higher, it’s worth monitoring the $205 area. This area may provide overhead selling pressure near a series of<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/peak-and-trough-analysis/\"> peaks</a> that developed on the chart between November and February.</p><p>Finally, investors can forecast a potential price target above the stock’s <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/record_high.asp\">record high</a> by using the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/measuring-principle.asp\">measuring principle</a>, a technique that analyzes <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/112601.asp\">chart patterns</a> to project future price moves.</p><p>When applying the analysis to Palo Alto’s chart, we calculate the distance of the descending broadening formation from its low to high and add that amount to the pattern’s <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakout.asp\">breakout</a> point. For instance, we add $64 to $176, which projects a target of $240.</p><p><em>The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

    "summary": "Palo Alto Networks' shares fell nearly 7% on Wednesday, closing around $181, despite quarterly results exceeding Wall Street expectations. The decline was attributed to the company's guidance, which was mostly in line with forecasts but apparently failed to impress investors. This drop slightly pushed the stock into negative territory for the year, although it remains 25% higher than last month's low. Technical analysis suggests watching for key support levels at $180 and $165, and resistance levels near $205 and $240, as investors evaluate the company's shift to a cloud-based cybersecurity pl",
