Americans are <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/have-americans-been-panic-buying-cars-to-get-ahead-of-tariff-driven-price-hikes-11709204\">“panic buying” cars</a> so they can <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/retail-sales-jump-in-march-as-consumers-rush-to-buy-cars-to-beat-tariffs-11716230\">beat the heftier price tags</a> that many expect in the wake of <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/car-shopping-this-expert-suggests-you-buy-it-right-away-before-trump-tariffs-lift-prices-11708720\">auto-specific tariffs</a>.</p><p>However, the results may be less important as investors will likely be paying close attention to outlooks and increasing conversations around tariffs.

The bank predicts that production and sales will decline by about 3 million vehicles if auto tariffs stay at or near current levels. This could lower operating earnings for General Motors (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;GM\">GM</a>) by 11%, by 7% for Ford (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;f\">F</a>), 10 to 15% for suppliers, and 3% to 5% for dealers, they estimate.</p>"
