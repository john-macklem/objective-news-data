    "summary": "A recent study, involving scientists from the Institut Pasteur and CNRS, has discovered that leprosy was present in America centuries before Columbus's arrival. This finding challenges the previously held belief that the disease was introduced to the Americas by European colonizers. The conclusion is based on the analysis of ancient DNA extracted from archaeological remains in South America, offering new insights into the history and spread of leprosy.",
