The stock gained 12% to close Thursday at $339.51, and is up about 70% from last month's low point.</p><p>Below, we break down the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/technical-analysis-4689657\">technicals</a> on AppLovin’s chart and identify price levels that investors are likely watching.</p><h2>Bullish Momentum Set to Accelerate</h2><p>After setting a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/record_high.asp\">record high</a> in mid February, AppLovin shares staged a sharp reversal back to the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/013015/why-200-simple-moving-average-sma-so-common-traders-and-analysts.asp\">200-day moving average</a>, where they traded mostly sideways since that time.</p><p>However, the stock recently broke out above a falling wedge pattern and reclaimed the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012815/why-50-simple-moving-average-sma-so-common-traders-and-analysts.asp\">50-day moving average</a> in a move that coincided with the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp\">relative strength index</a> crossing back above the 50 threshold to signal improving price momentum.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at three crucial overhead areas on AppLovin’s chart worth watching, while also identifying an important <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp\">support level</a> to monitor during potential <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/020415/top-strategies-mastering-pullback-trading.asp\">pullbacks</a>.</p><h2>Crucial Overhead Areas Worth Watching</h2><p>The first overhead area to watch sits around $352. The shares could encounter selling pressure at this level near a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trendline.asp\">trendline</a> that connects the March peak and the upper range of a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consolidation.asp\">consolidation</a> period that formed on the chart throughout most of December and January.</p><p>A decisive <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/trading-breakouts.asp\">breakout</a> above this area could see the shares climb to $525. Investors who have averaged in at lower prices may decide to l<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lock_in_profits.asp\">ock in profits</a> in this region near the stock’s record high.</p><p>To project an overhead area to watch if the stock moves into <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricediscovery.asp\">price discovery</a> mode, investors can use the bars pattern tool. When applying this technique to AppLovin’s chart, we extract the stock’s <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptrend.asp\">uptrend</a> from August to December last year that commenced from the 200-day MA and reposition it from last month’s touch of the 200-day MA. This analysis projects a potential longer-term bullish move up to around $940 if price action rhymes.</p><h2>Important Support Level to Monitor</h2><p>During pullbacks in the stock, it's worth keeping track of the $235 level. Retracements to this important <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp\">technical</a> area would likely attract strong buying interest near last month’s initial breakout point from the falling wedge pattern, which also closely aligns with the March trough.</p><p><em>The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
