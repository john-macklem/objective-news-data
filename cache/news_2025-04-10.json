The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite skyrocketed 12.2%—its second-largest daily gain since the turn of the century and its best day since January 2001. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.8%, its best day since March 2020 and fifth-best since 2000.</p><p>Investors breathed a sigh of relief on Wednesday when President Trump implemented a 90-day pause on most of the tariffs that <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/liberation-day-tariffs-go-into-effect-11711517\">went into effect overnight</a>. Trump shocked Wall Street last Wednesday when he unveiled tariffs that were <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/how-much-reciprocal-tariff-will-be-for-each-country-trump-trade-11708072\">broader and steeper</a> than investors had expected. Stocks tumbled in the following days as economists warned the tariffs would <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/economists-see-greater-chance-of-recession-with-trump-tariffs-11710261\">likely weigh on global growth and stoke inflation</a>. </p><p>Wednesday’s rally recouped much of the losses the major indexes have suffered in the last week. The Nasdaq, which finished yesterday’s session more than 13% off its pre-“Liberation Day” close, is now down just 2.7%. The S&amp;P 500 has pared its losses from 12.1% to 3.8%, and the Dow closed Wednesday 3.8% off its level before the tariffs were announced. </p><p>“The stock market rebound is a combination of speculative investors needing to cover short positions; less fear of recession and stagflation; and optimism that tariff rates will ultimately end up lower than they are threatened today,” Comerica Bank Chief Economist Bill Adams said.<em>  </em></p><p>The tariff pause comes just days before big banks are slated to <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/here-are-three-things-to-watch-for-in-big-bank-earnings-trump-dimon-11711177\">kick off first-quarter earnings season</a>, with JPMorgan Chase (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;JPM\">JPM</a>) scheduled to report on Friday. Its CEO Jamie Dimon warned in his annual letter to shareholders on Monday that the tariffs <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/jpmorgan-ceo-dimon-says-tariffs-will-slow-down-growth-11710093\">would slow down growth</a>, and early Wednesday Dimon called a recession “a likely outcome” of the tariffs. Bank stocks <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/big-bank-stocks-fall-as-jamie-dimon-says-recession-is-likely-outcome-of-tariffs-11711869\">surged</a> in response to the tariff pause Wednesday.</p><p>Wednesday’s pause and rally could change the tone of earnings calls in the coming weeks. “This pause may provide companies with a clearer backdrop for their guidance, offering some relief to a market hungry for direction,” wrote Gina Bolvin, President of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, on Wednesday. (Analysts have been expecting tariff uncertainty to cause the number of companies offering sales and earnings guidance <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trump-tariff-uncertainty-could-make-for-bumpy-q1-earnings-season-11710723\">to drop sharply</a> this quarter.) </p><p>“However, uncertainty looms over what happens after the 90-day period, leaving investors to grapple with potential volatility ahead,” Bolvin added. </p>"

The Dow advanced 7.9%, while the Nasdaq rocketed 12.2% higher.</p><p>The technology sector outperformed as stocks that had been clobbered by concerns about the impact of extensive tariffs clawed back some of their recent losses. Shares of microcontroller and analog chipmaker Microchip Technology (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;mchp\">MCHP</a>) jumped 27.1%, notching the best daily performance of any S&amp;P 500 stock, while shares of power management semiconductor provider Monolithic Power Systems (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;mpwr\">MPWR</a>) popped 23.4% higher.</p><p>Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;amd\">AMD</a>) shares, which have garnered significant attention because of the firm's artificial intelligence (AI) chips, surged 23.8%. The push higher for the stock came in spite of a downgrade to \"sector weight\" from \"overweight\" by analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets, who cited downside risks to gross margins amid increasing price competition with Intel (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;intc\">INTC</a>).</p><p>Delta Air Lines (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;dal\">DAL</a>) lifted the airline industry by reporting <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/delta-q1-fy2025-earnings-11711038\">better-than-expected sales and profit results</a> for its fiscal first quarter. Although Delta announced plans to cut back on capacity growth in the second half of the year as it navigates the uncertain economic environment, its shares took off following the strong earnings report, gaining 23.4% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, shares of rival carrier United Airlines (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;ual\">UAL</a>) soared 26.1%.</p><p>Telsa (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;tsla\">TSLA</a>) shares gained 22.7% in the wake of the tariff reprieve. In addition, the research firm Benchmark included the electric vehicle maker's stock among its best investment ideas, noting a more attractive valuation following recent price declines, the potential for a recovery in sales driven by a new vehicle launch, and potential catalysts from Tesla's robotaxi and self-driving initiatives.<br /></p><p>The heaviest loss among S&amp;P 500 constituents was on Dollar General (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;dg\">DG</a>) shares, which slipped 1.9%. The stock managed to buck the downtrend in the broader markets this week as concerns about deteriorating macroeconomic conditions boosted the outlook for cost-conscious consumers seeking bargains at the discount retailer's stores. Dollar General shares also attracted an upgrade earlier this week from analysts at Melius Research, who highlighted the company's relative lack of exposure to tariffs.</p><p>Shares of MarketAxess Holdings (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;mktx\">MKTX</a>), which operates an electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, fell 1.5% after UBS trimmed its price target on the stock. Although analysts lifted their first-quarter earnings estimates to reflect increased credit volume, they anticipate that lower pricing could restrain revenue growth during the period.</p>"
