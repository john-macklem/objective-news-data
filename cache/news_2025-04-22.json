However, not all energy was cheaper. The cost of gasoline fell significantly and outweighed electricity and natural gas increases. Food prices grew 3.0% from the same time last year.</p><p>Food and energy prices can fluctuate from month to month for reasons that have little to do with broader inflation trends. For that reason, economists and Fed officials often pay special attention to \"core\" inflation measures, which exclude prices for food and energy. That number rose 2.8% over the last 12 months, the smallest increase since March 2021.</p><h2>Why Does It Matter to the Federal Reserve?</h2><p>The Federal Reserve uses its influential <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp\">federal funds rate</a> to help curb <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\">inflation</a>, which is defined as a broad rise in prices for goods and services over time.</p><p>When the fed funds rate is higher, borrowing, including on credit cards and through loans, is more expensive. That often<strong> </strong>decreases consumers' and businesses' spending, which, in turn, should help moderate the rate of price increases.</p><p>The Fed has set its annual inflation goal at 2% because of the <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100715/breaking-down-federal-reserves-dual-mandate.asp\">dual mandate</a> Congress gave the central bank: keep inflation low and employment high. To balance those two things, the Fed has to find a place where its key interest rate is high enough to keep inflation from flaring, but low enough that it doesn't constrict hiring.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span></p><p>The Federal Reserve pushed its rates to a peak of 5.25%-5.50% in the wake of the pandemic, when inflation flared. As inflation started to slow, the Fed gradually cut its rates by a full percentage point late last year.</p><p>However, despite Trump's persistent comments that they should, central bankers have not touched the rate so far this year.</p><h2>What Happens Next?</h2><p>Part of the reason the Fed is content to hold its influential interest rate is that what happens next with inflation is murky.</p><p>Since the beginning of the year, Trump has implemented <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tariff-tracker-where-do-president-trump-trade-proposals-stand-11702803\">several tariff policies</a> that economists expect will push up prices on items across the economy. The <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/welcome-to-the-uncertainty-economy-11691573\">policies' off-again, on-again nature</a> has <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trump-tariffs-stock-market-volatility-buying-opportunity-11713537\">created uncertainty in financial markets</a> and <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tariff-fears-bring-consumers-back-to-inflation-heyday-of-2022-11697052\">depressed consumer and business leader sentiment</a> about the economy's future.</p><p>The uncertainty has left central bankers in \"wait-and-see\" mode as they look for the effects of tariffs on the economy. After their last meeting in March, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said they were in no hurry to cut rates.</p><p>\"The new administration is in the process of implementing policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. It is the net effect of these changes that will matter for the economy, and for the path of monetary policy,\" he said. \"While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their effects on the economic outlook is high.”</p><p>If Trump's highest tariff proposals are enacted, inflation could<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/a-self-inflicted-economic-catastrophe-trump-tariffs-raise-inflation-unemployment-recession-risks-11708571\"> jump to 4.7% by the end of the year</a>, by one estimate. If that happens, it would likely encourage the Fed to raise rates further, rather than cut them.</p>"

The latest Trump criticisms are making investors even less confident about the U.S. dollar and the country’s dominant role in global financial markets, analysts say.</p><p>Markets had “already started to entertain notions of <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-de-dollarization-7559514\">de-dollarization</a>” following Trump’s tariff policies, according to Themistoklis Fiotakis, a top strategist at the British bank Barclays. Trump is adding fuel to the fire, Fiotakis wrote, bringing about risks to the dollar that are “too large to ignore.”</p><p>“The notion of the Fed independence being at risk … is an event that carries very significant tail risks not only for the dollar, but also for the global financial system,” Fiotakis wrote in a note to clients. </p><p>The concerns about Fed independence added to lingering concerns about the impact of tariffs on the economy, sparking a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04212025-11718673\">volatile session of trading on Monday</a>. Major stock indexes fell more than 2%, U.S. Treasury securities sold off again, and the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/us-dollar-slumps-3-year-low-trump-powell-fed-independence-11718779\">dollar hit its weakest level in three years</a>. </p><p>The sell-off followed a Truth Social post on Monday from Trump calling Fed Chair Jerome Powell a “major loser” and saying that <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trump-renews-criticisms-of-fed-chair-powell-s-interest-rate-policy-11718759\">lower inflation figures call for rate cuts</a> “NOW.” Last week, <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trump-hints-at-firing-powell-after-fed-chair-signals-no-rate-cut-soon-11717006\">he wrote Powell’s termination</a> \"cannot come fast enough,” raising concerns that the president would seek to fire the central banker. </p><p>Financial markets are clearly uncomfortable with the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/what-would-happen-if-the-fed-answered-to-the-president-8644170\">politicization of the central bank</a>, Thierry Wizman, global currency and rates strategist at the Australian financial services firm Macquarie, said in an interview. </p><p>“The market is okay with rates coming down. What the market is not okay with is having the president or politicians tell the Fed that the rates need to come down,” Wizman said.</p><h2>What’s Different This Time Around?</h2><p>Powell is no stranger to Trump’s attacks. Trump appointed Powell as Fed chairman during his first term as president, though he’d soon sour on Powell and criticize him publicly. In 2019, he questioned whether Powell was a bigger “enemy” for the United States than Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p><p>Despite his criticisms, Trump ultimately opted against removing Powell and thus avoided any legal fights that could ensue.

However, not all energy was cheaper. The cost of gasoline fell significantly and outweighed electricity and natural gas increases. Food prices grew 3.0% from the same time last year.</p><p>Food and energy prices can fluctuate from month to month for reasons that have little to do with broader inflation trends. For that reason, economists and Fed officials often pay special attention to \"core\" inflation measures, which exclude prices for food and energy. That number rose 2.8% over the last 12 months, the smallest increase since March 2021.</p><h2>Why Does It Matter to the Federal Reserve?</h2><p>The Federal Reserve uses its influential <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp\">federal funds rate</a> to help curb <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\">inflation</a>, which is defined as a broad rise in prices for goods and services over time.</p><p>When the fed funds rate is higher, borrowing, including on credit cards and through loans, is more expensive. That often<strong> </strong>decreases consumers' and businesses' spending, which, in turn, should help moderate the rate of price increases.</p><p>The Fed has set its annual inflation goal at 2% because of the <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100715/breaking-down-federal-reserves-dual-mandate.asp\">dual mandate</a> Congress gave the central bank: keep inflation low and employment high. To balance those two things, the Fed has to find a place where its key interest rate is high enough to keep inflation from flaring, but low enough that it doesn't constrict hiring.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span></p><p>The Federal Reserve pushed its rates to a peak of 5.25%-5.50% in the wake of the pandemic, when inflation flared. As inflation started to slow, the Fed gradually cut its rates by a full percentage point late last year.</p><p>However, despite Trump's persistent comments that they should, central bankers have not touched the rate so far this year.</p><h2>What Happens Next?</h2><p>Part of the reason the Fed is content to hold its influential interest rate is that what happens next with inflation is murky.</p><p>Since the beginning of the year, Trump has implemented <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tariff-tracker-where-do-president-trump-trade-proposals-stand-11702803\">several tariff policies</a> that economists expect will push up prices on items across the economy. The <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/welcome-to-the-uncertainty-economy-11691573\">policies' off-again, on-again nature</a> has <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trump-tariffs-stock-market-volatility-buying-opportunity-11713537\">created uncertainty in financial markets</a> and <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tariff-fears-bring-consumers-back-to-inflation-heyday-of-2022-11697052\">depressed consumer and business leader sentiment</a> about the economy's future.</p><p>The uncertainty has left central bankers in \"wait-and-see\" mode as they look for the effects of tariffs on the economy. After their last meeting in March, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said they were in no hurry to cut rates.</p><p>\"The new administration is in the process of implementing policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. It is the net effect of these changes that will matter for the economy, and for the path of monetary policy,\" he said. \"While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their effects on the economic outlook is high.”</p><p>If Trump's highest tariff proposals are enacted, inflation could<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/a-self-inflicted-economic-catastrophe-trump-tariffs-raise-inflation-unemployment-recession-risks-11708571\"> jump to 4.7% by the end of the year</a>, by one estimate. If that happens, it would likely encourage the Fed to raise rates further, rather than cut them.</p>"

The latest Trump criticisms are making investors even less confident about the U.S. dollar and the country’s dominant role in global financial markets, analysts say.</p><p>Markets had “already started to entertain notions of <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-de-dollarization-7559514\">de-dollarization</a>” following Trump’s tariff policies, according to Themistoklis Fiotakis, a top strategist at the British bank Barclays. Trump is adding fuel to the fire, Fiotakis wrote, bringing about risks to the dollar that are “too large to ignore.”</p><p>“The notion of the Fed independence being at risk … is an event that carries very significant tail risks not only for the dollar, but also for the global financial system,” Fiotakis wrote in a note to clients. </p><p>The concerns about Fed independence added to lingering concerns about the impact of tariffs on the economy, sparking a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04212025-11718673\">volatile session of trading on Monday</a>. Major stock indexes fell more than 2%, U.S. Treasury securities sold off again, and the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/us-dollar-slumps-3-year-low-trump-powell-fed-independence-11718779\">dollar hit its weakest level in three years</a>. </p><p>The sell-off followed a Truth Social post on Monday from Trump calling Fed Chair Jerome Powell a “major loser” and saying that <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trump-renews-criticisms-of-fed-chair-powell-s-interest-rate-policy-11718759\">lower inflation figures call for rate cuts</a> “NOW.” Last week, <a class=\"recommendation-inline-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trump-hints-at-firing-powell-after-fed-chair-signals-no-rate-cut-soon-11717006\">he wrote Powell’s termination</a> \"cannot come fast enough,” raising concerns that the president would seek to fire the central banker. </p><p>Financial markets are clearly uncomfortable with the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/what-would-happen-if-the-fed-answered-to-the-president-8644170\">politicization of the central bank</a>, Thierry Wizman, global currency and rates strategist at the Australian financial services firm Macquarie, said in an interview. </p><p>“The market is okay with rates coming down. What the market is not okay with is having the president or politicians tell the Fed that the rates need to come down,” Wizman said.</p><h2>What’s Different This Time Around?</h2><p>Powell is no stranger to Trump’s attacks. Trump appointed Powell as Fed chairman during his first term as president, though he’d soon sour on Powell and criticize him publicly. In 2019, he questioned whether Powell was a bigger “enemy” for the United States than Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p><p>Despite his criticisms, Trump ultimately opted against removing Powell and thus avoided any legal fights that could ensue. Former President Joe Biden reappointed Powell as Fed chair for a term that is due to end in May 2026.</p><p>In his second term, Trump has been more forceful in removing independent agency leaders, whether at the Federal Trade Commission or the National Labor Relations Board. </p><p>It’s unclear whether he will bring that same view to the Fed. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has told the White House that firing Powell could prompt turmoil in financial markets, according to <em>Politico</em>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span> But Kevin Hassett, a top Trump economic adviser, said on Friday that the White House will “continue to study that matter.”<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span></p><p>“We’d be remiss to conclude that the president’s rhetoric won’t lead to action,” Ian Lyngen, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients. </p><p>If he does attempt to remove Powell, the question could end up in the Supreme Court, Lyngen wrote.</p><p>“At a moment in which the Administration has already instilled ever-higher levels of uncertainty into the economic outlook, any attempt to remove Powell will add to the downward pressure on U.S. assets,” he wrote.<br /></p>"

This area also sits just below a projected bars pattern <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downside.asp\">downside</a> target that takes the stock’s downtrend following an earlier descending triangle on the chart and repositions it from the current pattern’s top trendline, with the analysis assuming a downward continuation move may play out.</p><h2>Important Overhead Areas Worth Tracking</h2><p>Amid potential recovery efforts in the stock, investors should keep a close eye on the $289 level. This region on the chart could provide considerable selling pressure near the 200-day MA, last month’s <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swinghigh.asp\">swing high</a>, and the stock’s post-election <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakawaygap.asp\">breakaway gap</a> closing price.</p><p>Further buying in Tesla shares could drive a move up to $360.
