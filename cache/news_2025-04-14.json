For instance, we add $200 to $3,180, which projects an upside target of $3,380, about 4% above the commodity’s current trading levels.</p><h2>Key Support Levels Worth Watching</h2><p>The first lower level to eye sits around $3,170. This area on the chart may provide support near the early-April <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/peak-and-trough-analysis/\">peak</a>, which also marks the commodity’s former record high.</p><p>A close below this area could see the price revisit support at the $3,048 level. Investors may seek <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entry-point.asp\">entry points</a> in this location near a minor March peak that preceded a brief dip later that month.</p><p>The next lower level to watch lies at $2,955. The commodity could attract buying interest in this region near the early-April trough, which also closely aligns with the prominent February peak.</p><p>Finally, bullion <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bull.asp\">bulls</a>' failure to defend this level may trigger a more significant drop to around $2,858. Investors could look for buying opportunities at this location on the chart near the late-February pullback low.</p><p><em>The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
