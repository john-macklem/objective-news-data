However, the stock has nearly doubled from last month’s low amid a rebound in the AI trade and expectations that the firm’s software could benefit from ongoing efforts to improve government efficiency.</p><p>Below, we break down the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/technical-analysis-4689657\">technicals</a> on Palantir’s chart and identify major price levels that investors may be watching.</p><h2>Pennant Pattern Breakout</h2><p>After forming a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/piercing-pattern.asp\">piercing pattern</a> early last month, Palantir shares have staged a sharp rally, climbing above the prominent February <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/peak-and-trough-analysis/\">peak</a> in the process. </p><p>More recently, the price <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consolidation.asp\">consolidated</a> within a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennant.asp\">pennant</a> before breaking out in Tuesday’s trading session, indicating a continuation of the stock’s longer-term <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptrend.asp\">uptrend</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp\">relative strength index</a> points to bullish momentum with a reading above the indicator’s neutral threshold, though it remains below <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overbought.asp\">overbought</a> levels, providing ample room for further buying.</p><p>Let’s use <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp\">technical analysis</a> to forecast where the AI software provider’s stock may be headed next and also identify major <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp\">support levels</a> worth watching during potential retracements.</p><h2>Bars Pattern Analysis</h2><p>To forecast where the stock’s price may be headed next, investors can use bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes prior <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trendanalysis.asp\">trends</a> to predict future price movements.</p><p>When applying the analysis to Palantir’s chart, we extract the price bars comprising the stock’s trending move that immediately preceded the pennant and reposition them from the pattern’s <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/trading-breakouts.asp\">breakout</a> point. </p><p>This projects an <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/upside.asp\">upside</a> target of around $210 and indicates the move may play out until early to mid-June if the current trend higher replicates the prior trend analyzed.</p><h2>Major Support Levels Worth Watching</h2><p>During retracements, investors should pay close pay attention to the $97 level, currently situated just above the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012815/why-50-simple-moving-average-sma-so-common-traders-and-analysts.asp\">50-day moving average (MA)</a>. The shares may encounter support in this area near the March peak, which closely aligns with brief period on consolidation that formed on the chart in mid-April.</p><p>Finally, selling below this major level could see Palantir shares test lower support around $66. Investors may seek <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entry-point.asp\">entry points</a> in this region near the close-by 200-day MA and a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/horizontal-line.asp\">horizontal line</a> that connects last month’s low with the notable January trough.</p><p><em>The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
