      "The reliable manipulation of the speed at which light travels through objects could have valuable implications for the development of various advanced technologies, including high-speed communication systems and quantum information processing devices. Conventional methods for manipulating the speed of light, such as techniques leveraging so-called electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effects, work by utilizing quantum interference effects in a medium, which can make it transparent to light beams and slow the speed of light through it."
