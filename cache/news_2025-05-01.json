    "summary": "A new study has analyzed the genomes of the domesticated apple and its wild relatives within the Malus genus, revealing insights that could improve apple breeding for taste and resilience. By comparing the genetic makeup of these species, researchers have traced the evolutionary path of apples over nearly 60 million years, identifying key genetic variations. This knowledge is expected to guide future efforts to cultivate apples that are both more flavorful and robust.",
