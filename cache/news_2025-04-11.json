Relief over President Trump's decision to postpone higher tariffs on trading partners around the world gave way to concerns about escalating tensions with China, with the White House confirming that the levy on goods from the country now stands at 145%.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 slid 3.5%.

The company opted not to provide specific financial forecasts for fiscal 2026 and stepped away from its previously announced long-term growth targets, noting that macroeconomic factors could affect its timeline for reaching those objectives. Analysts have suggested that tariffs <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/cars-are-nearly-guaranteed-to-get-more-expensive-as-u-s-mulls-tariffs-11694969\">could result in higher prices</a> for new and used vehicles.</p><p>After yesterday's <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/s-and-p-500-gains-and-losses-today-index-roars-back-after-reprieve-on-reciprocal-tariffs-11711797\">blistering rally for semiconductor stocks</a>, downward pressure on chipmakers resumed on Thursday.

Shares of power module specialist Monolithic Power Systems (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;mpwr\">MPWR</a>) also gave back a portion of Wednesday's strong gains, falling 13.7%.</p><p>Warner Bros. Discovery (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;wbd\">WBD</a>) shares lost 12.5% after the China Film Administration said it would cut down the number of American films imported into the country as trade tensions escalate between the world's two largest economies.

The price uptick helped lift gold-mining stocks. Shares of Newmont (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;nem\">NEM</a>), the world's top gold producer, notched the strongest gain in the S&amp;P 500, jumping 4.5%.</p><p>Shares of fixed-income trading platform operator MarketAxess Holdings (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol&#61;mktx\">MKTX</a>) advanced 3.5% on Thursday, recovering from a slight decline posted in the prior session.
