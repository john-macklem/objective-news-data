His drive into the short par-four 14th is heading straight for the flag. A little bit to the right and it’s landing on the green and rolling out into Max Homa territory. But it’s not a little bit to the right. It takes a kick left off a bank just in front of the green and into the drink. Having taken his drop, he chips up to six feet, but pulls the attempted par saver. He taps in for bogey on a hole that Homa nearly made albatross, and all for the sake of a few feet either way in the landing zone. Hatton launches his ball into the water and exits the scene, powered solely by the steam pouring from his lugs. He’s -4.</p><p><strong>The erstwhile PGA and Open champion Collin Morikawa has also started fast.</strong> Birdies at 10 and 12 and he’s -3. Bryson DeChambeau gets up and down from 43 yards on 10 to open with birdie; he’s -1. And JJ Spaun birdies 2, 3 and 4, though this year’s Players Championship runner-up hands one of those strokes back at 5.
