In just the last two days, “chaos” has cropped up in more than 100 such reports.</p><p>Companies may choose caution as they report results; ones that have already offered first-quarter guidance have been <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/more-s-and-p-500-companies-are-giving-downbeat-outlooks-11706496\">increasingly wary</a>.</p><p>“We will see an upcoming earnings season for 1Q in which it would not surprise us if many companies/mgmt teams did not give guidance,” Wedbush analysts wrote last week.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span> They expect this coming earnings season to resemble early 2020 when uncertainty about the spread of Covid-19 and the longevity of lockdowns caused the number of S&amp;P 500 companies issuing guidance to plummet by more than 50% year-over-year, according to data from FactSet Research.</p><p>Market participants are already struggling to make sense of Trump’s tariffs and the impact they could have on their investments. Less guidance would likely reduce investors’ visibility even further, making it more difficult to model earnings growth and, thus, value debt and equity. </p><p>\"At a minimum, we will likely see companies give more conservative guidance or wider ranges than normal for guidance,\" said John Butters, Vice President and Senior Earnings Analyst at FactSet.</p><p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on Sunday said more than 50 countries had initiated talks with the administration, seeking relief from the tariffs set to take effect on Wednesday.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\"></span> </p>"

This strategy follows a significant 34% tariff imposed by the U.S. on Chinese imports, exacerbating the financial strain on Apple, which produces most of its hardware in China. The company's stock has fallen approximately 20% since the announcement of the new tariffs. Apple's move to shift some production to India is seen as a temporary solution to avoid the tariff impact, which could necessitate a 6% p",
