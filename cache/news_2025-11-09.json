Awarded the Nobel Prize in 1962 with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, his later years were overshadowed by controversy due to his racist and sexist comments. Despite his significant contributions to genetics and science, his remarks led to widespread criticism and ostracization from the scientific community. Watson's legacy remains complex, marked by groundbreaking achievements and contentious views.",
